# RAN-System

> **README being written**


Initially, I create this project to have an application to manage the storage of different electronics components. After few weeks, I saw the potential of this project and now I will develop a complete system that works on Raspberry with Node.js and communicates with some Arduino boards, to control devices and make some things easier.
